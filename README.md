Basic Jquery Todo application that stores the input in your local browser.

Add your input to the todo items by clicking on the button.

Change your list items by clicking on them and change the value with the prompt.
(Still a small bug, the item that was changed will not be removed from storage, so when you reload the new edited and the old item will appear. You can then delete it manual)

Delete items from your list by clicking on the trashcan of the item.
